        'desc': `Throughout the semester, my partner and I chose to do an educational website to advocate for the problem of women being mistreated in the gaming industry. Our topic is about the phenomenon of sexism and discrimination against women in the gaming world. Nowadays there are a lot of users who make a big deal about others sex on the Internet especially in video games because of its ability to hide their real identity. With the rise of technology and gaming, so many users are entering this industry, especially women. While the user group of women are increasing in gaming, this user group is getting terribly mistreated just because of their sex. Creating an educational website would best advocate for this topic because we can show highlights of different clips of women getting mistreated in their games as well as various screenshots of women revealing their encounters with toxic users from different social media platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok. Furthermore, creating an educational website will heavily emphasize the importance of this issue as well as raise effective awareness to other users that are in this industry. Moreover, we hope to inform users about this issue through showing sensitive information such as video clips, stream highlights, and screenshots of women being abused and hopefully reduce this problem to make the gaming world a safer place for users. `,

        'desc': `Women experience harassment and discrimination in the gaming industry for many reasons. One of the reasons why women experience harassment and discrimination from users online is for not being as good as other players in the video game. For example, if there were two teams playing competitively against each other and one team had a woman, if that woman didn't perform well, the team would automatically blame the loss on her. Another reason as to why women may experience such negativity in the gaming industry is for giving advice to the team. Some users don’t like taking advice from individuals online, especially women because they think that they don’t know anything or how anything works just because they are a female gamer. Furthermore, women get harassed on a daily basis for, you guessed it, being a woman. When online users see a woman in their game, they start to “troll” and say uncomfortable comments. An example of some uncomfortable comments would be “bark for me, go do the dishes, mommy, etc…”. Uncomfortable comments and frequent harassment tend to make female gamers not talk in game and hide their identity. In addition, women are scared to talk to their teammates because of what they might say due to their voice. Most women who play first person shooter games often don’t talk which puts their team at a disadvantage. An example of this came from a YouTube video that we sourced that showed streamer “IShowSpeed” bad mouthing a woman on his stream for giving him advance on what to do. In the YouTube clip, IShowSpeed says “get off the game and do your husband's dishes” (IShowDemons Plug, 2022). This is one of the few many instances of how women get treated in video games for talking. This behavior conducted by popular streamer “IShowSpeed” is unacceptable and gives women another reason to not talk and enjoy the video game without any stress or frustration.

Big Twitch streamer “JasonR” is accused of discriminating women in VALORANT. JasonR refuses to play with any girl. As you can see in the tweet, every time he is queued up with a woman on his team, he will “dodge” as in queue another game or mute them. Furthermore, this is just one of the many instances where JasonR will not play with any female gamers/women. Streamer JasonR will pretend that his Wi-Fi disconnected and close the game and then queue up again to avoid playing with women. This is known as “dodging” in the game VALORANT.

Big Twitch streamer “IShowSpeed” gets banned from playing any Riot game because of his behavior on VALORANT. In one of his streams, his audience clipped a scene where IShowSpeed harasses a female gamer just for talking to him and giving him advice on how to get better. The video surfaced on social media platforms such as TikTok and Twitter and a Riot employee got a hold of it. For this action done by the streamer, IShowSpeed got banned for making sexist comments towards a woman in one of his matches. `,

        'desc': `The topic of sexism and discrimination towards women in the gaming industry has been an issue for a very long time. Based on the research we have gathered, there are possible potential solutions to reduce/combat this problem. One way that we can all start to reduce this problem is by treating all users with respect. We don’t know what other users are going through on a daily basis so by trolling, making sexist remarks, and discriminating, it could damage them even more. Furthermore, many users, including myself, play video games to distress and escape from reality. Another solution to this problem is by having the video game company implement harsher consequences. Consequences and penalties can include in chat and voice restrictions, chat and voice bans, account bans, and in extreme cases, IP address bans. By implementing chat and voice restrictions, it will allow the safety for harassed users from receiving anymore negative comments. We believe that this is one of the most effective ways to combat this issue because developers can implement AI to scan and listen into every match and penalize those who do not abide by the rules. Furthermore, the ban restrictions can vary from minutes to permanently banned depending on the severity of the account. Secondly, another way to effectively combat this issue is by banning the player entirely from the game. With this, it would require a little more work as the developers of the game have to manually determine if this is the right thing to do. Moreover, banning players entirely, will help get rid of toxic players slowly and create a safe place for all users to enjoy the game. Overall, users turn to video games to escape from reality and to distress. By implementing a system where toxic users get punished, it will create a safer online environment.

        'desc': `After intense and thorough research, some key takeaways from this topic is that the gaming industry is rising with women. As stated early on this year, women make up 48% of all gamers in this industry. Furthermore, women have been faced with sexism and discrimination for a very long time even outside of the gaming industry. Technology has always been dominated by predominantly men. Moreover to reduce and stop this issue, we all need to work together as well as the video game companies. There needs to be restrictions on games to reduce this problem, there should be consequences and penalties on players who act out of line. Moreover, the severity of the case should be used to determine how players are penalized.
