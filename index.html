        'desc': `Throughout the semester, my partner and I chose to do an educational website to advocate for the problem of women being mistreated in the gaming industry. Our topic is about the phenomenon of sexism and discrimination against women in the gaming world. Nowadays there are a lot of users who make a big deal about others sex on the Internet especially in video games because of its ability to hide their real identity. With the rise of technology and gaming, so many users are entering this industry, especially women. While the user group of women are increasing in gaming, this user group is getting terribly mistreated just because of their sex. Creating an educational website would best advocate for this topic because we can show highlights of different clips of women getting mistreated in their games as well as various screenshots of women revealing their encounters with toxic users from different social media platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok. Furthermore, creating an educational website will heavily emphasize the importance of this issue as well as raise effective awareness to other users that are in this industry. Moreover, we hope to inform users about this issue through showing sensitive information such as video clips, stream highlights, and screenshots of women being abused and hopefully reduce this problem to make the gaming world a safer place for users. `,

        Since then, the gaming industry has been dominated by men in which women are the minority and regularly experience harassment and discrimination
        <br>
        In 2014, the gaming industry consists of 61% men, 30% women, and 8% non-binary
        <br>Moving forward to 2022, women now make up 48% of the gaming industry

        tit: 'Category Four (Why does this happen?):',
        'desc': `Women experience harassment and discrimination in the gaming industry for many reasons. One of the reasons why women experience harassment and discrimination from users online is for not being as good as other players in the video game. For example, if there were two teams playing competitively against each other and one team had a woman, if that woman didn't perform well, the team would automatically blame the loss on her. Another reason as to why women may experience such negativity in the gaming industry is for giving advice to the team. Some users don’t like taking advice from individuals online, especially women because they think that they don’t know anything or how anything works just because they are a female gamer. Furthermore, women get harassed on a daily basis for, you guessed it, being a woman. When online users see a woman in their game, they start to “troll” and say uncomfortable comments. An example of some uncomfortable comments would be “bark for me, go do the dishes, mommy, etc…”. Uncomfortable comments and frequent harassment tend to make female gamers not talk in game and hide their identity.

In this article titled “Women are continuing to face harassment, toxicity in VALORANT by Oliva Richman, Richman talks about how women who play VALORANT experience a lot of sexism and discrimination. The author shares a woman's experience and how got treated by other users. She said that her toxic teammates said she “sounded like a whore” despite not even knowing what she looked like. Furthermore, making comments like this hurts the individual and therefore making the user mute chat and voice chat. `,

        'desc': `The topic of sexism and discrimination towards women in the gaming industry has been an issue for a very long time. Based on the research we have gathered, there are possible potential solutions to reduce/combat this problem. One way that we can all start to reduce this problem is by treating all users with respect. We don’t know what other users are going through on a daily basis so by trolling, making sexist remarks, and discriminating, it could damage them even more. Furthermore, many users, including myself, play video games to distress and escape from reality. Another solution to this problem is by having the video game company implement harsher consequences. Consequences and penalties can include in chat and voice restrictions, chat and voice bans, account bans, and in extreme cases, IP address bans.
